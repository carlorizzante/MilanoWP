/**
 * THEMES
 *
 * Theme Rules aren't as often used within a project and
 * because of that, they aren't included as part of the
 * core types. Some projects may have a need for them,
 * though, and you may want to use this section to keep
 * them separated from the overall styling of the site,
 * and apply them only when requested.
 *
 * {@link https://smacss.com/book/type-theme}
 *
 * Below an example, where the theme-class will be applied to
 * the body of the page procedurally via PHP or via Javascript.
 *
 * Remember to remove the comment in _main.scss if you
 * want to import this file into the final style.css file
